# Firebase Realtime Database: Intermittent `PERMISSION_DENIED` Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase's Realtime Database: encountering `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors even when security rules seem correct.

The problem often stems from:

* **Authentication Issues:** The client might not be authenticated correctly before attempting database operations.
* **Rule Inconsistencies:** The security rules might have logical flaws or subtle inconsistencies that prevent authorized access.
* **Caching:** Firebase client may be caching outdated security rules leading to permission errors.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `solution.js` provides a solution to handle authentication and potential rule inconsistencies.
