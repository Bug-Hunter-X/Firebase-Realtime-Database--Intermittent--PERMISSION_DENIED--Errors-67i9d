The Firebase Realtime Database sometimes throws a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error even when the security rules appear to be correctly configured.  This often happens when there's a mismatch between the client's authentication state and the rules, or when the rules themselves have subtle flaws or inconsistencies. Another reason is the caching mechanism which might not reflect real time changes.
